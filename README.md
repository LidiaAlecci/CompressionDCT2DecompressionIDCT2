CompressionDCT2DecompressionIDCT2.

This is a student project required for the course of scientific calculation methods at the first year of the master degree in Computer Science at University of Milano-Bicocca.

#Request
It was required:
- First part: comparing DCT2 implemented by the student and DCT2 implemented by a library in its fast version (FFT).
- Second part: developing a user interface that get in input a greyscale bitmap image, a number F and a number d. This software will give in output the same image but use the DCT2 and IDCT2 and cut the frequencies c(k,l) with k+l >= d.

In this project the user interface is a web app created with Shiny.

#How to compile
Use RStudio open the file "ui.R" or "server.R" and in the interface of RStudio click on RunApp.

It was developed in may 2020.
